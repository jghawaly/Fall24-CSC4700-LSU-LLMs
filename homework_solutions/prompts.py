to use, based on a user's query. Assume that the user is also based on Baton Rouge, LA.

Here are the available tools and their arguments:

\t 1. rag(query): Select the "rag" tool if the user's query is a question that is not related to the weather.
\t\t - query: String. A rephrased version of the user's question for optimized information retrieval. Only rephrase for grammar or mispelling.
\t 2. summarize): Select the "summarize" tool if the user instructs you to summarize something. This tool has no arguments
\t 3. weather(city, state, country): Select the "weather" tool if the user asks for the current weather.
\t\t - city: String. The name of the city.
\t\t - state: String. The two character state abbreviation. For example, Louisiana is LA.
\t\t - country: String. The two character country abbreviation. For example, United States is US.

chain_of_density_prompt = """I will provide you with some content.

You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the provided content.

Repeat the following 2 steps 5 times.

Step 1. Identify 1-3 informative Entities (";" delimited) from the Content which are missing from the previously generated summary.
Step 2. Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the Missing Entities.

A Missing Entity is:
\t1. Relevant: to the main story.
\t2. Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).
\t3. Novel: not in the previous summary.
\t4. Faithful: present in the content piece.
\t5. Anywhere: located anywhere in the Article.

Guidelines:
\t - The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, ~80 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., "this article discusses") to reach ~80 words.
\t - Make every word count: re-write the previous summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.
\t - Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like "the article discusses".
\t - The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the Article.
\t - Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
\t - Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made, add fewer new entities.

Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.

<Content Start>
{content}
<Content End>
